# Darkelf Post-Quantum Secure Browser

## Overview
**Darkelf Browser** is a hardened, privacy-first secure browser developed for investigative journalists, activists, penetration testers, and advanced security professionals. Designed to combat advanced persistent threats, it incorporates **post-quantum cryptography**, live JavaScript malware detection via machine learning, and memory-resident anti-forensics.

Built on a fortified QtWebEngine base, Darkelf ensures no disk persistence, disables swap, and isolates all sessions in hardened runtime environments.

## üß¨ Post-Quantum Editions
Darkelf is available in two post-quantum variants:

| Edition       | PQ Crypto   | ML Detection | Status       | Notes                                  |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Kyber768**  | Kyber768    | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ Tested     | Balanced performance and encryption    |
| **Kyber1024** | Kyber1024   | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ Production | Highest-strength security tier         |

## üîí Core Capabilities

### üîê Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Uses **Kyber768** or **Kyber1024** from liboqs
- Implements secure key encapsulation (KEM)
- Derives AES-GCM session keys via HKDF
- Keys and secrets live only in memory

### üß† Real-Time JavaScript Malware Detection
- Trained `RandomForestClassifier` (scikit-learn)
- Feature extraction + entropy analysis on console JS logs
- Auto-blocks fingerprinting or malicious scripts
- Model integrity checked via `.sha256`

### üõ° Anti-Fingerprinting & Privacy Suite
- JS APIs blocked or randomized (Canvas, WebGL, Fonts, Audio)
- Network-level protections (spoofed UA, anti-ETag, spoofed headers)
- CSP and DOM injection to block leaks
- Prevents WebRTC, Geolocation, Timezone, and Device-based tracking

### üïµÔ∏è Anti-Forensics & Stealth
- Self-deletion on detection of forensic tools or debuggers
- Disables swap and clears memory buffers
- Anti-VM checks (MACs, environment, user, hostname)
- In-memory encrypted logs using `Fernet`

### üåê Secure and Anonymous Networking
- Full Tor routing (via `stem` and SOCKS5 proxy)
- Fallback to DoH and DoT if Tor is down
- Adds jitter, timing noise, and encrypted padding to all traffic

### üì¶ Hardened Web Engine Runtime
- Sandboxed WebEngine with hardened settings
- JS disabled by default, per-tab toggles
- Download manager strips EXIF, PDF metadata
- Runtime obfuscated + encrypted cookie store

## üìÅ Included Components

- `darkelf.py`: Main application launcher
- `kyber_crypto.py`: Post-quantum key encapsulation logic
- `ml_script_classifier.pkl`: Trained ML model (malicious JS detection)
- `scaler.pkl`: StandardScaler model for feature normalization
- `.ml_script_classifier.sha256`: SHA256 of model for hash check
- `CustomWebEnginePage`: Custom JS log parser and ML hook
- `StealthCovertOps`: RAM-only logging and anti-forensics
- `ObfuscatedEncryptedCookieStore`: Secure ephemeral cookie store

## üß™ ML Training & Retraining
To regenerate the model:
```bash
python train_script_classifier.py
```
This script outputs:
- `ml_script_classifier.pkl`
- `scaler.pkl`
- `.ml_script_classifier.sha256`

Includes:
- Cross-validation accuracy report
- Test set predictions
- Feature entropy analysis
