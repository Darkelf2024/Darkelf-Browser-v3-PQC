# Darkelf Browser v3.0: A Post-Quantum Secure Browser for Adversarial Environments

## Abstract

This paper presents **Darkelf Browser v3.0**, an open-source, hardened web browser designed for operational security in hostile environments. Built with memory-resident anti-forensics, machine learning-powered malicious JavaScript detection, and post-quantum cryptographic protections, Darkelf seeks to raise the standard of privacy-first, investigator-oriented software. This version integrates the **ML-KEM-768** and **ML-KEM-1024** key encapsulation mechanisms from the NIST PQC finalists, offering quantum-resilient encryption alongside forensic evasion and real-time telemetry interception. Designed by Dr. Kevin Moore, the browser is released under the **LGPL license** and available at [https://darkelfbrowser.com](https://darkelfbrowser.com).

## 1. Introduction

The rise of advanced tracking techniques, remote forensic tooling, and post-quantum threat modeling presents new challenges for journalists, analysts, and security professionals. Darkelf Browser v3.0 addresses this need by merging hardened browser internals with next-generation security features. This research paper outlines the architecture, features, and implementation logic of the browser's security mechanisms, including JavaScript anomaly detection, Tor routing, memory-only logging, and canvas/WebGL anti-fingerprinting defenses.

## 2. Post-Quantum Cryptography Implementation

Darkelf supports both **ML-KEM-768** and **ML-KEM-1024**, two lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms standardized by NIST. Using the **liboqs** library, the browser generates ephemeral keypairs per session:

* **Ephemeral Keypairs**: Generated in RAM only; keys are destroyed on close.
* **AES-GCM Session Encryption**: Shared secrets derived via HKDF to form AES-256-GCM symmetric keys.
* **Nonce Management**: Secure nonces generated per encryption operation.

This ensures forward secrecy and future-proofing against quantum adversaries while maintaining efficient performance.

## 3. JavaScript Threat Detection via Machine Learning

Darkelf's **CustomWebEnginePage** class captures `console.log()` outputs from JavaScript and performs real-time classification:

* **Feature Extraction**: Includes function length, fingerprinting API calls, entropy scoring, network behavior, and eval usage.
* **Model**: `RandomForestClassifier` trained using `scikit-learn==1.6.1` with cross-validation.
* **Hash Checking**: The `.pkl` ML model is verified via `.sha256` to prevent tampering.
* **Auto-blocking**: Malicious or fingerprinting JS is halted at runtime.

## 4. Anti-Fingerprinting Protections

Darkelf aggressively spoofs or disables fingerprinting surfaces:

* **Canvas API**: Overridden or returns random noise.
* **WebGL Vendor/Renderer**: Faked via JS injection.
* **Fonts/Screen Size**: Spoofed dimensions and enumerations.
* **Navigator, Audio, Battery, Timezone**: Randomized or blocked access.
* **CSP Injection**: Content Security Policies enforce script integrity.

These defenses are applied dynamically upon page load and are enabled by default.

## 5. Anti-Forensics & Memory-Only Logging

Darkelf does not write to disk by default. Instead:

* **StealthCovertOps** logs events in encrypted in-memory buffers using Fernet.
* **Secure Erase Routines**: Overwrite memory before clearing.
* **Forensic Tool Detection**: Background threads scan for debuggers, VM indicators, and forensic process names.
* **Self-Destruct**: Deletes keys and exits if a forensic threat is found.

## 6. Secure Networking Stack

All traffic is routed through **Tor** using `stem` and `socks5h`. If Tor is unavailable:

* **DoH/DoT Fallback**: DNS over HTTPS/TLS using Cloudflare.
* **Timing Noise**: Traffic includes randomized delays.
* **Encrypted Padding**: Custom socket layer adds entropy to outbound packets.

## 7. Hardened QtWebEngine Runtime

The browser disables a wide array of features:

* **JavaScript Disabled**: By default, with user override.
* **WebRTC Disabled**: Avoids local IP leaks.
* **Local Storage, WebGL, Media Devices**: Disabled at runtime.
* **Download Manager**: Strips EXIF and PDF metadata on download.
* **Cookie Store**: `ObfuscatedEncryptedCookieStore` stores cookies encrypted in RAM only.

## 8. Machine Learning Retraining

Users can retrain the JS malware classifier by running:

```bash
python Darkelf_script_classifier.py
```

This script performs feature extraction, model training, cross-validation, and updates the following:

* `ml_script_classifier.pkl`
* `scaler.pkl`
* `.ml_script_classifier.sha256`

## 10. Conclusion

Darkelf Browser v3.0 represents a unique integration of post-quantum encryption, forensic evasion, and ML-based threat modeling within a hardened Qt framework. It is suitable for offensive research, privacy-conscious users, and professionals operating in high-risk digital environments.
