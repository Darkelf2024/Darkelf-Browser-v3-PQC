# :shield: Darkelf Browser

**Darkelf** is a post-quantum secure, memory-resident, anti-forensic browser designed for adversarial environments. It is not a general-purpose browser â€” it is a specialized tool for cybersecurity research, threat simulation, and secure web interaction in high-risk contexts.

## :rotating_light: Disclaimer

> **Darkelf Browser is intended solely for cybersecurity research, educational use, digital rights advocacy, and professional security operations.**  
It is not designed for mainstream web browsing or casual use.

This browser includes advanced features that resist forensic recovery and enable ephemeral, RAM-only sessions. Such capabilities are powerful and must be deployed responsibly. Use is subject to applicable laws and ethical guidelines. The author assumes no responsibility for misuse.

## :white_check_mark: Intended Use Cases

### :red_circle: Red Team Operations
- Simulates real-world attacker behavior in penetration testing environments
- Leaves no persistent artifacts
- Includes self-destruct and debugger detection to model advanced APT behaviors

### :detective: OSINT Investigations
- Enables anonymous reconnaissance
- Provides anti-tracking and identity shielding for exploring sensitive public data sources
- Ideal for investigating extremism, disinformation, or threat actors without risk of traceback

### :police_officer: Law Enforcement & Forensic Analysis
- Useful for **digital forensics training** and **counter-forensic tool evaluation**
- Safe malware interaction and exploit site inspection
- Secure internal communications under surveillance

### :newspaper: Investigative Journalists & Whistleblowers
- Protects sources and communication channels from forensic analysis and surveillance
- Supports encrypted, RAM-only sessions with no disk artifacts
- Designed for use in repressive environments where privacy is critical

### :bust_in_silhouette: Privacy Advocates & Human Rights Defenders
- Empowers individuals under surveillance to browse safely
- Open-source and auditable
- Compatible with privacy infrastructures (e.g., VPNs, Tails OS)
